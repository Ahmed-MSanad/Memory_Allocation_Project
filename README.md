# Memory_Allocation_Project

This project implements a simulation of a basic memory allocation scheduling mechanism. Each process requires a specific amount of memory to initiate execution. If the required memory is not readily available, the process is placed in a waiting list until sufficient memory becomes available. Throughout the simulation, the status of memory allocation, waiting processes, and running processes is maintained until all processes have completed execution.
